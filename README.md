## Sign-up Form
This is a sign-up form for an imaginary service made for The Odin Project. The point of this project was to showcase my HTML and CSS skills but I tried to implement some JavaScript too to validate form inputs cause I didn't like how it worked with just basic HTML. 

## What could be improved
* clean up the code cause I think there's some repetition that could be improved
